# Key Actions for RSeQC
* Comprehensively evaluate high throughput sequence data, especially RNA-seq data

## Basic RSeQC Modules
* Sequence quality
* Nucleotide composition bias
* PCR bias
* GC bias

## RNA-seq Specific
* Sequencing saturation
* Mapped reads distribution
* Coverage uniformity
* Strand specificity
* Transcript level RNA itegrity

## FastQC vs RSeQC
* FastQC only focuses on raw sequence-related metrics
    + Not enough to ensure the usability of RNA-seq data
* RSeQC accesses the quality of RNA-seq experiments

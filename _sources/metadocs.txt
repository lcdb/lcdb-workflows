Building documentation
======================

From the top-level dir of the repo:

.. code:: bash

  bash docs/build-docs.sh

Then check http://lcdb.github.io/lcdb-workflows to see the updates.

Specifically, this script:

  - build the sphinx documentation in its current state in the current directory
  - clone the repo from github into a temp dir
  - checkout the `gh-pages
    <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/>`_
    branch
  - copy the built documentation over to the temp repo's ``gh-pages`` branch
  - add everything that was copied
  - make a git commit (referring to the current commit of the entire repo)
  - push the changes to github

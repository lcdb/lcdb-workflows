  title: My Very Cool Project
  Author: Bob

  # path like settings
  data: /data/bob/original_data

  # conda environment names
  python2: py2.7

  # names to access specific envs by
  env: HOME

#### Experiment Level Settings ####
# experiment level settings, settings that apply to all samples
exp.settings:

  # Sample information relating sample specific settings to sample ids
  sampleinfo: sample_metadata.csv

  # it would be nice to be able define a setting here that applies to all
  # samples, or define for each sample in the sampleinfo table case they are
  # different.
  fastq_suffix: '.fastq.gz'
  # Need to some way to specify annotation to use, maybe here is not the best
  # place.
  annotation:
    genic: /data/...
    transcript: /data/....
    intergenic: /data/...
  # add modeling information here
  models:
    formula: ~ sex + tissue + time
    # tell which columns in sample table should be treated like factors
    factors:
      - sex
      - tissue
      - time

#### Workflow Settings ####
# I think using a naming scheme that follow folder structure would be useful.
# For example: if there is a workflows folder then we could define workflow
# specific settings
workflows.qc:
  # List pieces of the pipeline to run, (or not run may be better)
  steps_to_run:
      - fastqc
      - rseqc
  # or could have logical operators switches to change workflow behavior
  trim: True

workflows.align:
  # define what software to use and optionally what version
  aligner: 'tophat2=2.1.0'
  aggregated_output_dir: /data/...
  report_output_dir: /data/...

workflow.rnaseq: ...

workflows.references: ...

#### Rule Specific Settings ####
# rule level settings again with naming based on folder structure if we need
# folder structure
rules.align.bowtie2:
  # It would be nice to be able to have cluster settings with rule setting,
  # can't think of a way to get this to work, probably just need a separate
  # cluster config.
  cluster:
      threads: 16
      mem: 60g
      walltime: 8:00:00
    # bowtie index prefix
    index: /data/...
    # Access to any parameters that need set
    params:
      # place to change the options
      options: -p 16 -k 8

    # place to change how files are named
    aln_suffix: '.bt2.bam'
    log_suffix: '.bt2.log'
